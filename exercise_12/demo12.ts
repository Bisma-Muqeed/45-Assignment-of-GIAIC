//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name

let Name = ["Haziq", "Hiba", "Farheen", "Arhaam"];

Name.forEach(a => console.log(`Hello ${a}, What are you doing`));
