//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name
var Name = ["Haziq", "Hiba", "Farheen", "Arhaam"];
Name.forEach(function (a) { return console.log("Hello ".concat(a, ", What are you doing")); });
